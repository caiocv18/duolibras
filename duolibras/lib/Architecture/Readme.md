The separate code layers of MVVM are:

Model: This layer is responsible for the abstraction of the data sources. Model and ViewModel work together to get and save the data.
View: The purpose of this layer is to inform the ViewModel about the userâ€™s action. This layer observes the ViewModel and does not contain any kind of application logic.
ViewModel: It exposes those data streams which are relevant to the View. Moreover, it servers as a link between the Model and the View.
